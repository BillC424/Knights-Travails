# Knights-Travails
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-knights-travails

Project to create a knight_moves method to show the shortest possible way to move from one square to another square on a chess board. This involved creating classes for the chess board, each square on the board, the Knight piece, and the nodes/adjacency list used for determining the shortest path. This challenged my understanding of data structures, breadth first searches, and classes/instance variables.

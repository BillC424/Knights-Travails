# Knights-Travails

Project to create a knight_moves method to show the shortest possible way to move from one square to another square on a chess board. This involved creating classes for the Knight piece, nodes, and adjacency list used for determining the shortest path. This challenged my understanding of data structures, breadth first searches, and classes/instance variables.
